    >snip<<br>
    Techonomy's name embodies our beliefs and our mission-it combines the words "technology" and "economy" because technology has become a central part of the economy in which we operate and the society in which we live. Today technology is inextricably entwined with just about every activity that humans undertake. We embrace that fact, and seek as a company to help the world take advantage of it**.

      I say that Eric Schmidt's involvement in the Obama Campaign is his "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom">Torches of Freedom</a>" moment.
      </li>
      <li>
      I say that Eric Schmidt's babys, Google+ and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_search">Social Search</a>, are where the <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/11/a-new-google-patent-and-a-turing-test-for-social-media.html">patented google-bots</a> roam.
      <li>
      I say that The Powers That Be rely on Eric "Fucking" Schmidt to obfuscate search and keep discussions stirred up, depending on the needs of the NSA, of course.

      <li>
      I say that I may be wrong.

    <h2>intext:"Eric Fucking Schmidt"</h2><br> 
 
 

Web search for a quoted string that gets no results:

       </a>
       
  <p>
  Okay, nothing in the last month, but they are trying to be nice by showing some unquoted hits.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maybe a month is too short.  Lets try a year. (<i>All</i> I did was change "Past month" to "Past year"):

       </a>
  <p>
  Damn, some internet trolls are google bombing poor Eric! 
  </p>
  <p>
  Wait!  What?  I see what you did there!  The results are for the string <i>unquoted</i>, with no notification of the change, other than the easy to miss two little double quote marks disappearing just as the results appear.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Put the damn quotes</i> back, and:

  <p>
  Maybe there is an innocent explanation. 
  </p>
  <p>Google verbatim was supposed to allowed me to search the old way, the old pre social way, the way the that made google such an insanely great engineering company, with search tools you could trust. Until.Eric.Fucking.Schmidt.
  </p>
  <p>
  So, Google likes to strip quotes out of a verbatim search string that has no hits, They change the displayed search string after the search refinement results have been presented.
  </p>
  <p>
  Subtle and easy to miss. This was very irritating until I figured out the quote sleight of hand.  Now I routinely copy the query to paste in as needed.
  </p>
  <p>
  But something a bit different happens if you click on the Image tab after an unsuccessful web search:
  </p>
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Is+Eric+Schmidt+not+the+new+Edward+Bernays%3F%22&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=47jAUpGjBsefkQeQhIG4DA&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1438&bih=790" target="_blank">
    <img title="I always enjoin an image search on strings such as Is Eric Fucking Schmidt not the new Edward Bernays? See how I twisted the law of betteridge as well?"

       </a>
  <p>
  It did not strip the quotes out, but they are gone without so much as a by your leave when you continue to refine the search.

    <blockquote>
    (Sean Hannity:) Thank you both -- Jay, I'm looking at not only the contamination story of the USS Reagan Navy crewmembers but, you know, "this is a race against time." You know, "Japan's frantic efforts to avoid a meltdown." Some people say, "we were told not to breathe the air, it's scary." How realistic is this threat?
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    JAY LEHR, THE HEARTLAND INSTITUTE: Sean, it is not at all realistic. I can tell you with the utmost confidence there will not be a health impact of anything that is going on at the Fukushima power plant. A meltdown, people interpret it as virtually a disaster, and explosion, destruction like an atomic bomb that is not true at all. A meltdown just means that the cooling of the rods has failed. The temperature is higher than can be controlled in order to create the hot water that ultimately flashes to steam and turns a turbine. So, they immediately install rods to bring the radioactive decay down to subcritical but they have leftover heat and residual radiation that has to be brought under control, it will happen naturally within a few days. They are doing the best they can.

    Any truth in there?  I can't even parse three fourths of the word salad.
