    Techonomy's name embodies our beliefs and our mission-it combines the words "technology" and "economy" because technology has become a central part of the economy in which we operate and the society in which we live. Today technology is inextricably entwined with just about every activity that humans undertake. We embrace that fact, and seek as a company to help the world take advantage of it**.

      I say that Eric Schmidt's involvement in the Obama Campaign is his "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom">Torches of Freedom</a>" moment.

      I say that Eric Schmidt's babys, Google+ and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_search">Social Search</a>, are where the <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/11/a-new-google-patent-and-a-turing-test-for-social-media.html">patented, Turing tested, google-bots</a> roam.
      <li>
      I say that The Powers That Be rely on Eric "Fucking" Schmidt to obfuscate search, keep discussions stirred up and attention diverted, depending on the needs of the NSA of course.

      I say that I may be wrong.

Web search for a quoted string that gets no results:

  <p>
  Okay, nothing in the last month, but they are trying to be nice by showing some unquoted hits.
  </p>
  <p>
  Maybe a month is too short.  Lets try a year. (<i>All</i> I did was change "Past month" to "Past year"):

       </a>
  <p>
  Damn, some internet trolls are google bombing poor Eric! 
  </p>
  <p>
  Wait!  What?  I see what you did there!  The results are for the string <i>unquoted</i>, with no notification of the change, other than the easy to miss two little double quote marks disappearing just as the results appear.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Put the damn quotes</i> back, and:

  <p>
  Maybe there is an innocent explanation. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Google verbatim was supposed to allowed me to search the old way, the old pre social way, the way the that made google such an insanely great engineering company, with search tools you could trust. Until.Eric.Fucking.Schmidt.
  </p>
  <p>
  So, google.com now strip quotes out of a verbatim search string that has no hits. They change the displayed search string as the search refinement results are presented.
  </p>
  <p>
  Subtle and easy to miss. This was very irritating until I figured out the quote sleight of hand.  Now I routinely copy the query to paste in as needed.

    <blockquote>
    (Sean Hannity:) Thank you both -- Jay, I'm looking at not only the contamination story of the USS Reagan Navy crewmembers but, you know, "this is a race against time." You know, "Japan's frantic efforts to avoid a meltdown." Some people say, "we were told not to breathe the air, it's scary." How realistic is this threat?
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    JAY LEHR, THE HEARTLAND INSTITUTE: Sean, it is not at all realistic. I can tell you with the utmost confidence there will not be a health impact of anything that is going on at the Fukushima power plant. A meltdown, people interpret it as virtually a disaster, and explosion, destruction like an atomic bomb that is not true at all. A meltdown just means that the cooling of the rods has failed. The temperature is higher than can be controlled in order to create the hot water that ultimately flashes to steam and turns a turbine. So, they immediately install rods to bring the radioactive decay down to subcritical but they have leftover heat and residual radiation that has to be brought under control, it will happen naturally within a few days. They are doing the best they can.

  That's some invisible hand you got there, Eric.  Let us see some examples of your NSA prompted social bots (<i>iBernays?</i>) in action!

  <p>
  Notice how conveniently timed the Time Warner / Viacom deal was.  And look into that hit number 2.  We catch <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/12/obamas-nsa-watchdog-reasonable-to-track-cars/">Cass Sunstein saying:</a>
  </P>
  
  <blockquote>
<i>Some "conspiracy theories" recommended for covert action by Sunstein include:</i>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>"The theory of global warming is a deliberate fraud."</i></li>
    <li><i>"The view that the Central Intelligence Agency was responsible for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy."</i></li>
    <li><i>"The 1996 crash of TWA flight 800 was caused by a <b>U.S. military missile*.</b>"</i></li>
    <li><i>"The Trilateral Commission is responsible for important movements of the international economy."</i></li>
    <li><i>"That Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by federal agents."</i></li>
    <li><i>"The moon landing was staged and never actually occurred."</i></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  * The documentary did not investigate who shot the three missiles, just the fact that the FBI thwarted NTSB investigators showed that the fatal explosion happened outside the aircraft.<br><br>
  Talk about burying your lead!
  </p>
  <p>
  Now, you know you'll be baffled by bullshit if you extend this search to video (go ahead, try it. I'll wait...). Just take the time to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wxgyUyvpRs">damn documentary</a> and decide. It has great production values, I swear!
