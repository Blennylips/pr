  Maybe a month is too short.  Lets try a year. (<i>All</i> I did was change "Past month" to "Past year"):

  <p>
  <i>Put the damn quotes</i> back, and:

  <p>
  Maybe there is an innocent explanation. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Google verbatim was supposed to allowed me to search the old way, the old pre social way, the way the that made google such an insanely great engineering company, with search tools you could trust. Until.Eric.Fucking.Schmidt.
  </p>
  <p>
  So, google now strip quotes out of a verbatim search string that has no hits. They change the displayed search string unquoted, as results are presented below.
  </p>
  <p>
  Subtle and easy to miss. And Maybe its just a bug. This was very irritating until I figured out the quote sleight of hand.

    (Sean Hannity:) Thank you both -- Jay, I'm looking at not only the contamination story of the USS Reagan Navy crewmembers but, you know, "this is a race against time." You know, "Japan's frantic efforts to avoid a meltdown." Some people say, "we were told not to breathe the air, it's scary." How realistic is this threat?
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    JAY LEHR, THE HEARTLAND INSTITUTE: Sean, it is not at all realistic. I can tell you with the utmost confidence there will not be a health impact of anything that is going on at the Fukushima power plant. A meltdown, people interpret it as virtually a disaster, and explosion, destruction like an atomic bomb that is not true at all. A meltdown just means that the cooling of the rods has failed. The temperature is higher than can be controlled in order to create the hot water that ultimately flashes to steam and turns a turbine. So, they immediately install rods to bring the radioactive decay down to subcritical but they have leftover heat and residual radiation that has to be brought under control, it will happen naturally within a few days. They are doing the best they can.

  That's some invisible hand you got there, Eric.  Let us see some examples of your NSA prompted social bots (<i>iBernays?</i>) in action!
  </p>
  <br>
  
  
  <h4>"NSA comment bot"</h4>
  
  
  <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?tbs=li:1#q=%22NSA+comment+bot%22&amp;tbm=nws" target="_blank">

      alt="WTF Eric"
       src="https://raw.github.com/Blennylips/pr/master/qTWAFlight800q.jpg">
       </a>
  
  <p>
  Notice how conveniently timed the Time Warner / Viacom deal was.  And by chance, look how they worded the press release!  Eric's iBernays has a chaff option.  And look into that hit number 2.  We catch <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/12/obamas-nsa-watchdog-reasonable-to-track-cars/">Cass Sunstein saying:</a>
  </P>
  
  <blockquote>
<i>Some "conspiracy theories" recommended for covert action by Sunstein include:</i>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>"The theory of global warming is a deliberate fraud."</i></li>
    <li><i>"The view that the Central Intelligence Agency was responsible for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy."</i></li>
    <li><i>"The 1996 crash of TWA flight 800 was caused by a <b>U.S. military missile*.</b>"</i></li>
    <li><i>"The Trilateral Commission is responsible for important movements of the international economy."</i></li>
    <li><i>"That Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by federal agents."</i></li>
    <li><i>"The moon landing was staged and never actually occurred."</i></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  * The documentary did not investigate who shot the three missiles, just the fact that the FBI thwarted NTSB investigators showed that the fatal explosion happened outside the aircraft.<br><br>
  Talk about burying your lead!
  </p>
  <p>
  Now, you know you'll be baffled by bullshit if you extend this search to video (go ahead, try it. I'll wait...). Just take the time to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wxgyUyvpRs">damn documentary</a> and decide. It has great production values, I swear!

  <p>
  So, sometime in the last few weeks I added this blog search through the google.com UI, after I first read <a href="http://www.popehat.com/2013/12/23/burn-the-fucking-system-to-the-ground/">popehat's epic rant.</a>.

  Just some of the buried text fragments in this ethicsalarms.com page:
  <ul>
  <li>After staying away from work for a day, Judge Pollack returned to the bench in the late afternoon, and presided over a courtroom packed with about a hundred drug offenders, along with  their friends and their families.</li>
  <li>It's been really devastating for her." Apparently her son is also suffering from a serious illness. Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, a longtime friend</li>
  <li>a recovering alcoholic in a critical position of public trust suffered a relapse, as alcoholics are wont to do. If one is an alcoholic, this is a symptom of a very persistent, pernicious and incurable disease that kills many Americans every year, does horrific damage to families, businesses, governments and the economy, and that is incurable</li>
  <li>It could trigger professional sanctions; it certainly should trigger an official inquiry.</li>
  <li>A Judge Shall Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety</li>
  <li>Being drunk as a skunk in public is not such an activity, Indeed, such conduct degrades and is profoundly damaging</li>
  <li>Friend Finklestein&#8217;s plea notwithstanding, this has nothing to do with kindness or compassion. What if she were an airline pilot</li>
  <li><b>Then, over at Popehat, one of Ken White&#8217;s co-bloggers, Clark, was apparently looking for a story on which to hang his rant about how the entire societal and governmental system in America is rotten to the core and how someone needs to &#8220;burn the fucking system to the ground.&#8221;</b></li>
  <li>The older I get, the more I see, the more I read, the more clear it becomes to me that the entire game is rigged. The leftists and the rightists each see half of the fraud. The lefties correctly note that a poor kid caught with cocaine goes to jail, while a Bush can write it off as a youthful mistake (they somehow overlook the fact that their man Barrack hasn&#8217;t granted clemency to any one of the people doing federal time for the same felonies he committed).</li>
  <li>The righties note that government subsidized windmills kill protected eagles with impunity while Joe Sixpack would be deep in the crap if he even picked up a dead eagle from the side of the road. The lefties note that no one was prosecuted over the financial meltdown. The righties note that the Obama administration rewrote bankruptcy law on the fly to loot value from GM stockholders and hand it to the unions.</li>
  <li>This is abusing another human being for a personal agenda. This is a violation of the Golden Rule. This is spreading falsehood to achieve one&#8217;s ends, misleading one&#8217;s readers, and as unethical as blogging can get.</li>
  <li>Never mind. Popehat&#8217;s readership exploded with applause over the rant, most never bothering to consider the brutally unfair characterization of the story that sparked it. Are people really this ignorant about alcoholism? Among the 298 comments, only four pointed out that Pollack</li>
  <li>and that Clark&#8217;s implication of hypocrisy is nonsense. None that I found made the critical distinction between illegal drug abuse and an alcoholism relapse, a distinction that Clark either intentionally blurred to support his rant, or somehow doesn&#8217;t comprehend.</li>
